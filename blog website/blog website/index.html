          <h3>Women Empowerement</h3>
          <p>
            Gender equality is, first and foremost, a human right. A woman is
            entitled to live in dignity and freedom. Empowering women is also an
            indispensable tool for advancing development and reducing poverty.
            Empowered women contribute to the health and productivity of whole
            families and communities and improved prospects for the next
            generation. The importance of gender equality is underscored by its
            inclusion as one of the eight Millennium Development Goals. Gender
            equality is acknowledged as being a key to achieving the other seven
            goals. Yet discrimination against womens including gender-based
            violence, economic discrimination, reproductive health inequities,
            and harmful traditional practices remains the most pervasive and
            persistent form of inequality. Since the beginning of civilization,
            there has been bulk evidence of women being considered inferior to
            men. Almost every country, no matter how progressive has a history
            of ill-treating women. This has eventually nudged women to
            retrospect their status in society and has even led women from all
            over the world to be rebellious to reach the status they have today.
            Since then, women have been vocal about gender equality and have
            continuously made efforts to empower themselves to achieve that
            equality. The empowerment and autonomy of women and the improvement
            of their political, social, economic, and health status is a highly
            important end in itself.
